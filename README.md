# 🚀 Exploring Electron with Electron Forge, Webpack, React, and TypeScript

This project is a personal exploration of building a desktop application using a modern stack consisting of **Electron**, **Electron Forge**, **Webpack**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. The goal is to understand how these technologies integrate and work together to create a cross-platform desktop app.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Electron**        | Framework for building desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS |
| **Electron Forge**  | Tooling for scaffolding, building, and packaging Electron apps |
| **Webpack**         | Powerful bundler for compiling and managing project assets |
| **React**           | Component-based UI library |
| **TypeScript**      | Strongly-typed superset of JavaScript |
| **pnpm**            | Fast and disk space-efficient JavaScript package manager |



## 💡 Key Learnings

- Set up a boilerplate using `electron-forge` with `webpack`, `react`, and `typescript` templates.
- Understood the separation between the **main** and **renderer** processes in Electron architecture.
- Configured Webpack to support hot reloading in the renderer (React) layer.
- Used TypeScript throughout the project to ensure type safety and better developer experience.
- Learned how to structure an Electron app for scalability and maintainability.



## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
starter-electron-forger/
├── src/
│   ├── main/                   # Electron main process entry
│   ├── renderer/               # React-based UI code
│   └── preload.ts              # Preload script (optional)
├── webpack.main.config.js      # Webpack config for main process
├── webpack.renderer.config.js  # Webpack config for renderer process
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```



## 🚀 Getting Started

Install dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm start
```



## 📦 Building & Packaging
To package the application into a distributable format (e.g., .exe, .dmg, etc.):

```bash
pnpm make
```



## 🔍 Future Improvements

* File system integration (read/write files using Node.js APIs)
* Add local storage using SQLite or IndexedDB
* Explore auto-updates using Electron Updater
* Implement IPC communication between main and renderer for advanced logic

## ✍️ Personal Notes
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of how modern front-end tools can be combined with Electron to create powerful desktop applications. Using pnpm significantly improved installation speed and reduced node_modules size through symlinks and content-addressable storage.
